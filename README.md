### 3.  Customer and Market Behavior Exploration

   * **High-Volume Customers**: Find customers who order the most (loyal customers). Strengthen relationships to retain them.
   * **Highest Revenue Customers**: Identify customers with whom we are getting highest revenue (*increase products which have more price*).
   * **Low-Revenue Customers**: Identify customers spending less. Gather feedback and offer incentives to improve their value.
   * **Industry Revenue Breakdown**: Analyze revenue by customer industry (e.g., Brick and Mortar vs. E-Commerce) to understand their contribution.
   * **Profitable Markets**: Focus on markets with high profit margins to maximize overall profitability.
   * **Low Profit/Sales Areas**: Identify markets with low profits or sales. Consider stopping sales to save on logistics and reinvest in stronger areas.

*All these metrics can be looked upon yearwise using year card widget.*
